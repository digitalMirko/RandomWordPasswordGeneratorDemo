Swift - Random Word and Password Generator Demo App

App created in Xcode 10.1 (10B61) using Swift 4.2 and tested on a iPhone X Emulator

To use this app the user just clicks the 'Random Word Password Generator Demo App' icon and they are taken right into the app. 
They are greeted with a large label that is labeled: "Click Button Below" on the top part of the screen with a button right 
below with the title "Create Single Example". Followed by a switch that has an option for Random Words or Password Gen.
(Default (on setting)). Then right below are a series of buttons labeled 1 through 9. These control how many elements will
be generated and displayed on the label at the top. Then right below the group of buttons is a single button that is labeled
"Reset". This resets the app back to its default stage and clears any generated text in the label.

This is a simple app which will either generate a Random number of words or a Password with a Random number of characters.
The design is set so the large blue button will just generate a simple item depending on how the switch is selected. The user
also has the option of selecting one of the numbered buttons and displaying more then just one character or word too. Then
followed by a 'Reset' button option to reset the label back to its original default position.

Note: The text used in the Random Words is from the Lorem Ipsum website. The characters used for the password are the standard 
alphabet along with numbers and special characters.
